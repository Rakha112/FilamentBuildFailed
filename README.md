I'm experiencing a build failure on Android after installing react-native-filament. This issue only occurs on Android, while it works perfectly on iOS.

Steps to reproduce

1. [Clone this repo](https://github.com/Rakha112/FilamentBuildFailed)
2. Install the package ( npm install )
3. Run the app ( npx expo run:android )
